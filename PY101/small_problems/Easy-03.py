# Print all even numbers from 1 to 99, inclusive, with each number on a separate line

# E
# 2
# 4
# 6
# 98

# D
# no input
# output integers on new lines

# Algorithm
# Should be able to handle this with index with a two step
# Need to be careful around start/end point inclusivity

# Code
for num in range(1, 99, 2):
    print(num + 1)
